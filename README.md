## 🟤 Business Problem  

Shopify stores often struggle to track and interpret key performance trends across multiple datasets such as transactions, customers, and products.  
Without an integrated view, it’s challenging to identify profitable regions, loyal customers, or underperforming categories.  

This dashboard bridges that gap by providing a centralized analytical view of sales, customer behavior, and payment performance through interactive visuals and KPIs.
